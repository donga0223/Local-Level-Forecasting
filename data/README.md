# Raw CDC NSSP Data

This directory contains the **raw CDC NSSP data** used for influenza emergency department visit analysis.

## How to Obtain the Data

You can obtain the data in two ways:

1. **Manual Download**  
   Visit the [CDC NSSP Data Portal](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NSSP-Emergency-Department-Visit-Trajectories-by-St/rdmq-nq56/about_data) and download the dataset manually.

2. **Programmatic Access in R**  
   You can download the data directly using the **`epidatr`** package:

   ```r
   epidatr::pub_covidcast(
     source    = "nssp",
     signals   = "pct_ed_visits_influenza",
     geo_type  = "state",
     geo_values = "sc",
     time_type = "week"
   )


# Health Service Areas (HSA)
   The HSA data were downloaded from [SEER](https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html). The dataset includes:
   - HSA ID (numeric code)
   - HSA Description
   - Stateâ€“County mapping
   - FIPS codes

   I also uploaded the corresponding `Health.Service.Areas.xls` file to this folder, which you can download from [here](https://github.com/donga0223/Local-Level-Forecasting/blob/main/data/Health.Service.Areas.xls).
