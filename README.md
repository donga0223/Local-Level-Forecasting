# Local-Level-Forecasting

This repository accompanies the paper Kim, D., et al. (2026+), Local Influenza Forecasts Outperform State-Level Forecasts in the United States.
The paper compares the performance of local-level influenza forecasting models with state-level forecasting models across the United States.
This repository contains all code used to fit the forecasting models, conduct analyses, and generate the figures presented in the paper.
All analyses rely exclusively on publicly available data.

## Repository organization

This repository has the following directories:

- `code/`: all code for GBQR forecasting and its component models, exploratory data analyses, and so on. See the readme in that folder for further information.
